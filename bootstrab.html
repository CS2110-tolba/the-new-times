                <p>
                    HTML is one of the most fundamental skills to learn in web design and development.
                    Learning HTML can be one of the best things your child does to better prepare themselves for future
                    success.
                    Not only will they learn how to read, write and speak code, but many universities are now accepting
                    HTML courses as college credits, too.
                    If you have a kid who you believe would excel in HTML, read on to learn more about what they can
                    learn with their coding course and why they may want to consider learning HTML.
                </p>
                <p>
                <p> What is HTML? </p>
                HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a computer language used to create websites and web
                pages. HTML is the foundation of webpages, and it is the building block of the internet.
                Learning HTML can provide many benefits for your child. HTML provides an easy way to create visually
                appealing and functional websites. For those interested in developing their website or blog,
                learning HTML can be a great start.

                <h2 id="a1"> Breaking: Puppies Are Adorable </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone responds differently to stress. Our family adopted a puppy.
                    It wasn't a casual decision. We had been talking about it for 18 months. I'd been lurking on
                    PetFinder for over a year and making inquiries with friends and family since last summer.
                </p>
                <p>It's a particularly good time for our family because four adults are sheltering at home, and young
                    puppies need a lot of attention to be well trained and socialized. We have the time! Shelters need
                    as much help as they can, as animals keep coming in, and strict hygiene measures make it especially
                    challenging to arrange for pets and new families to meet right now.

            <div class="A3">
                <h2 id="a1"> CSS Is Apprently A Thing </h2>
                <p>CSS is the abstraction of style away from anything else. Literally files you open and work on to
                    manage styles. You likely aren’t giving that up when moving to a JavaScript-based inline-style
                    setup. You’d just have, probably, style.js instead of style.css. You’d still be writing key/value
                    pairs and smooshing files together in a build process.
                    It will be different, but the authoring abstraction is still there.
                </p>
                <p>The scary “global” nature of CSS is neutered. The cascade, tapered. I don’t think you could say the
                    cascade is entirely gone, because some styles are inherited so styles can still be passed down to
                    child elements and that’s one definition of cascade. But the module-ish nature of this style of
                    development likely leads to less overlapping style concerns. A module over here is styled like this,
                    a module over there is styled like that – probably no conflicts in sight.

                <p>
                    Turtles are amazing creatures! They go on incredible journeys, have beautiful shells, can hold their
                    breath for hours and even cry salty tears. You can show you love them by not dropping litter on the
                    beach and NEVER buying anything made of tortoiseshell
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sea Turtles Lay Their Eggs In A Nest They Dig In The Sand With Their Rear Flippers. The Group Of
                    Eggs Is Called A Clutc
                    As reptiles, sea turtles breathe air, but they have the ability, under natural conditions, to remain
                    submerged for hours at a time. They even sleep underwater. Most sea turtles spend their entire life
                    at sea, only returning to nesting beaches to lay eggs
